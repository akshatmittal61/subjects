# Notes

## Introduction

Operating system is the interface between user and the hardware.

-   It acts as the resource (CPU, memory) allocator for the processes.
-   It acts as the manager for memory, processes, files, security etc.

## Goals

-   Primary goal: convienience
-   Secondary goal: efficiency

## Types of OS

-   **Batch OS**: There is only 1 computer, different jobs will take inputs from different users and they can wait for the result until the computer is done with them.

    In batch OS, when a process is taking some time at the I/O, CPU can't take another job until then. Hence, the throughput is very low in that.

## Process

-   Requirements: CPU, I/O
