Prestigious director sir, honorable principal mam, respected teachers and my dear friends a very warm morning to one and all present over here. My name is <your_name_here> and I'm from class 12th A. But I'm sure most of you all already know me as your vice house captain last year. This year I am standing as the nominee for the post of sports captain. 

I would absolutely love to be the leader of our school's sports community. Every post comes with duties and responsibilities. I promise to help everyone in any field whether it is about sports goods or about the leadership or any other relevant topic. I would try my best in bringing out the best in everyone. With your support and cooperation I believe that together we can grow and achieve new heights.

If you consider me eligible for the post of Sports captain, please follow my sombol, <your_symbol_name> and vote me on <voting_date>.

Thank You everyone and have a nice day.
